Abstract ( need intro Scyther)
 This paper introduces an enhanced Property-based Token Attestation scheme, PTA-HE, which integrates Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to strengthen security in mobile cloud computing environments. While traditional PTA protocols offer a foundational security layer, they often fall short in preserving data confidentiality and integrity during the attestation process, especially when data is actively being processed. PTA-HE addresses these shortcomings by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected and tamper-resistant even under continuous handling. The proposed scheme employs Trusted Third Parties (TTPs) and cloud servers to facilitate attestation, while HE safeguards plaintext data from exposure. We evaluate PTA-HE based on computational and communication overheads, latency, and scalability, demonstrating that although these factors increase relative to standard PTA, the enhanced security and privacy protections justify the trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a verification process using the Scyther tool, confirming the protocol’s improved correctness and robustness against a range of potential attacks. As a result, PTA-HE emerges as a compelling solution for applications where rigorous data privacy and integrity assurances are paramount.

Experimental work
Hardware Configuration
We utilized an Intel Core i9-10500 CPU with 128GB DDR4 RAM and a 1TB SSD. The rationale for selecting high-end hardware is to effectively support computationally intensive Homomorphic Encryption (HE) operations and simulations, ensuring accurate and consistent benchmarking of cryptographic overhead.
The use of a physical TPM 2.0 hardware module reflects real-world security practice, where Trusted Platform Modules are commonly employed in secure computing environments to store cryptographic keys and facilitate secure key management.
2. Software Environment
Our implementation was developed using Python, with PyCryptodome for standard cryptographic operations and the SEAL library for Homomorphic Encryption. Python provides a widely accepted, easily reproducible, and extensible programming environment suitable for prototyping complex cryptographic protocols. The choice of the SEAL library was deliberate, as it is widely recognized in academia and industry for robust HE implementations, providing reliable and standardized performance metrics.
3. Network Simulation
We modeled communication between mobile devices, the Trusted Third Party (TTP), and cloud servers (Verifiers) using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, widely utilized for accurate representation of distributed systems and network dynamics. A network configuration with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps and a latency of approximately 20 ms was deliberately chosen to reflect typical conditions in mobile and cloud computing scenarios, balancing realism with controlled reproducibility.
4. Cryptographic Parameters
We selected cryptographic parameters such as a 2048-bit RSA key size (common in secure communications today), which ensures a strong security baseline consistent with contemporary security standards. For Homomorphic Encryption, parameters (e.g., polynomial modulus degree, coefficient modulus, plaintext modulus) were chosen to reflect standard recommendations from the literature and previous benchmarks, ensuring both computational feasibility and cryptographic robustness.
5. Randomized Data Generation
Randomized simulation methods were incorporated to realistically model varying operational conditions, such as fluctuating network latency, computational load, and encryption/decryption times. This approach increases the reliability and generalizability of experimental results, mimicking the variability inherent in real-world deployments.
6. Metrics Selection
The metrics chosen for evaluation, computational overhead, communication overhead, latency, and scalability, directly reflect critical performance aspects relevant to mobile cloud computing security. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the protocol’s performance implications, highlighting practical trade-offs between security enhancements and operational efficiency.
7. Scalability Assessment
Scalability tests involved systematically increasing the number of mobile devices (from a single device up to larger scales) to demonstrate how performance metrics evolve under load, accurately reflecting real-world growth scenarios. The rationale behind scalability testing is to ensure that the enhanced PTA-HE scheme remains practical and efficient in environments with varying numbers of concurrent users.
